# CropEgde Studio üñºÔ∏è
Our proudly present project "CropEdge Studio" is an intuitive image processing tool designed to perform both edge detection and cropping on a variety of image formats. 

It integrates multiple edge detection algorithms and a user-friendly cropping interface to handle both individual and batch image processing. 


## Features

#### **1) Edge Detection**

Supports 3 powerful edge detection algorithms:

- **Roberts Cross Edge Detection:** A fast and lightweight algorithm that calculates gradients in diagonal directions, making it suitable for real-time edge detection in small or simple images.
- **Sobel Edge Detection:** Fast and efficient detection of gradients in x and y directions.
- **Laplacian Edge Detection:** Uses second derivatives for edge detection, capturing unique features.

Customizable parameters for each algorithm 

Batch processing support to handle multiple images or a ZIP archive.

Output results as processed image files.

#### **2) Cropping**

- Interactive cropping interface with a resizeable crop box.
- Supports individual and batch cropping, with the ability to adjust settings for each image.
- Output results to the user-specified directory.


## Tech used

- **Java** for core logic and GUI implementation.
- Various open-source **image processing libraries** for edge detection and cropping algorithms.
